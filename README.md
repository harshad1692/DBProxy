# DBProxy
A Python DB proxy is a script that acts as an intermediary between apps and databases, providing a unified interface for multiple DBs (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB). It simplifies connections, CRUD operations, and security, with extensibility for transactions, batch inserts, and DB-specific features like aggregations.
